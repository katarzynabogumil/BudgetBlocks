    <p id="landing-desc">BudgetBlocks is a tool that helps you keep your budget for a specific goal in check, for
      example: a trip, an event, or a home renovation. It allows you to set up new projects with a set budget goal with
      other users, add different expenses or even different options for each expense, and compare their effect on the
      overall cost.</p>
